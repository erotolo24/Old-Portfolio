        <h2>Hi, I'm Ethan Rotolo! I'm a kind, strong, and hardworking student at Marlboro High School, and I am taking the Web Design Pathway Program offered here at MHS.</h2>
        <h2>In the Web Design Pathway Program, my experience has been very fun and interesting. When you code, you really get to express yourself in the form of a website. For example, I got an award for using a very certain <span class="black">color</span> <span class="red">combination</span> for each of my websites (I bet you can't tell what it is, totally not my favorite colors) and I also like to make some of my websites look like dad jokes, to show my humorous side of my personality (and to get the class laughing)
        <h2>Technology and video games has always been my main interest since I was a kid, it is what I want my future career to be around. I've been taking as much computer classes as I can with both this Web Design Program and I will also soon be taking an AP Computer Science class in Junior year, where we will be using the coding language known as Java. I am not exactly sure what my job is going to be, whether it's programming, graphic design, animation, or maybe even working somewhere like <span class="red">Nintendo</span>? Nobody can predict the future, but I am getting as much experience as I can beforehand.</h2>
        <h2>I am a man of many hobbies and achievements. My greatest achievement has to be earning my second degree black belt rank in Taekwondo, I dedicate myself to having a well-rounded sparring style and also keeping a good physical condition to be light and fast on my feet. I have also been playing the electric guitar since I was a kid, and over the years of playing, my love for rock and metal music has grown, no one can ever convince me that the guitar isn't the best instrument known to man. I also inherit some artistic genes from my mother, and I have been drawing since I was very little. I recently have been trying to replicate the old-school 1930's cartoon art style, and I think I'm doing pretty good at it so far (you can see my self-portrait at the bottom!) And if it wasn't obvious enough, I spend a lot of time playing video games and using the internet. I've been working on digital art such as drawings on ProCreate, and logos using shapes, gradients, and pixel arts (GOOGLE SLIDES IS UNDERRATED)</h2>
        <h2>Some other fun facts about me before you leave: My favorite food is a soft shell taco, I prefer darker backgrounds over bright backgrounds (easier on the eyes, y'know?), and I am a huge fan of the Super Mario series along with other Nintendo franchises.</h2>
